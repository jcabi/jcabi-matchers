XHTML Hamcrest Matchers

  {{{./apidocs-${project.version}/com/jcabi/matchers/XhtmlMatchers.html}<<<XhtmlMatchers>>>}}
  is a utility class with static methods that create
  XHTML Hamcrest matchers, to be used in unit tests, for example:

+--
import com.jcabi.matchers.XhtmlMatchers;
import org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert;
public class FooTest {
  @Test
  public void buildsValidXml() {
    MatcherAssert.assertThat(
      "<data><employee id='33'><name>Jeff</name></employee></data>",
      XhtmlMatchers.hasXPath("/data/employee[@id=33]/name")
    );
  }
}
+--

  Besides that, there is a convenient static method that
  converts its input to XML, that correctly renders itself
  in unit test output:

+--
import com.jcabi.matchers.XhtmlMatchers;
import org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert;
public class FooTest {
  @Test
  public void buildsValidXml() {
    Source source = // ... get it somewhere
    MatcherAssert.assertThat(
      XhtmlMatchers.xhtml(source),
      XhtmlMatchers.hasXPath("/data/employee[@id=33]/name")
    );
  }
}
+--
