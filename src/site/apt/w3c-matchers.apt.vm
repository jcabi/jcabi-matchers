W3C Hamcrest Matchers

  {{{./apidocs-${project.version}/com/jcabi/matchers/W3CMatchers.html}<<<W3CMatchers>>>}}
  is a utility class with static methods that create
  W3C Hamcrest matchers, to be used in unit tests, for example:

+--
import com.jcabi.matchers.W3CMatchers;
import org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert;
public class FooTest {
  @Test
  public void htmlIsValidAccordingToW3C() {
    MatcherAssert.assertThat(
      "<html><body>Hello</body></html>",
      W3CMatchers.validHtml()
    );
  }
}
+--

  The same for CSS:

+--
import com.jcabi.matchers.W3CMatchers;
import org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert;
public class FooTest {
  @Test
  public void htmlIsValidAccordingToW3C() {
    MatcherAssert.assertThat(
      "body { color: red; }",
      W3CMatchers.validCss()
    );
  }
}
+--
